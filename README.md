# Loop Name Generator

Welcome to the Loop Name Generator, a fun and useful tool for generating unique names for your projects or creative endeavors!

## Overview

This project is built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), a powerful React framework with great performance and developer experience. It's bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) to get you up and running quickly.
